<h1>Review</h1>
<h5>i. Interest of Content</h5>
<p>The content is well wirtten, but shallow in its assessment of the topics it covers.</p>
<h5>ii. Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation</h5>
<p>Very consistent presentation, since all of your css came from Bootstrap. It may be simplistic, but it gets the job done. Use more images.</p>
<h5>iii. Quality of Written Presentation</h5>
<p>Well written, but I would have liked a deeper look.</p>
<h5>iv. Validity of html</h5>
<p>Valid but basic</p>
<h5>v. Evidence of Collaboration</h5>
<p>Several credited authors, contribution seems balanced.</p>

<p>Good job :)</p>
